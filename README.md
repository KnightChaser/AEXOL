A light **Discord bot with simple useful features** that is intended to run in 24/7-operating Linux or Windows server environment for Korean Discord users, written in Python, objected to impose object-oriented programming if able. I made it for a personal hobby.

This is the 3rd official challenge to make sustainable and scalable Discord chatbot with Python.

This bot supports features below currently
 - Alive check
 - Easily scalable `help` command feature
 - Get current time
 - Voice channel and live music playing with queue
 - Google index searching, sorting top results and related simple statistics
 - Authorization for specific commands
 - Exception catch


Improvement projects
 - [ ] Get current time with optional variable for different time zones
 - [x] Real-time cryptocurrencies information (first commit)
 - [ ] Google finance (stocks, indexes, news...)
